# AI-Engineer
About the Role 
We are a dynamic AI engineering team building innovative solutions for technical document 
processing, diagram detection, and intelligent automation using Large Language Models 
(LLMs). We are seeking two highly skilled AI Engineers to join our team in Chennai, India. 
In this role, you will develop scalable AI models, optimize workflows, and contribute to 
cutting-edge projects requiring strong mathematical foundations, particularly in geometric 
transformations. If you’re passionate about solving complex problems in a fast-paced 
environment, we’d love to hear from you!  
 
Job Responsibilities 

• AI Model Development: Design and implement DL models for document processing, diagram 
detection, data extraction, and LLM-driven automation.  
• Geometric Transformations & Math: Apply advanced mathematical techniques (e.g., 
geometric transformations, linear algebra) to analyze and manipulate technical data.  
• Data Processing: Preprocess and annotate structured/unstructured datasets from technical 
documents and diagrams.  
• Model Training & Deployment: Build and deploy models using C++, Python, and frameworks 
like TensorFlow or PyTorch, ensuring scalability with Docker and Apache Airflow.  
• Pipeline Development: Create and maintain robust AI pipelines for data ingestion, model 
training, and inference using Apache Airflow.  
• Collaboration: Work closely with AI engineers, software developers, and product managers to 
integrate AI solutions into production systems.  
• Optimization: Enhance model performance for real-time applications, focusing on low-latency 
and efficiency.
